    <p class="content">Obitopedia is a global platform where people and communities can celebrate the lives of their departed ones by creating memorials, by writing stories and tributes, by posting pic-tures, audio and video, and by sharing them with their loved ones—or with the world. It was born out of the belief that everyone deserves to have their life stories written down and remembered.
        We're accustomed to seeing very few peo-ple—mostly the wealthy and well-known—publicly memorializing their dear ones after death. At Obitopedia, we think that societies should recognize everyone who lived
